# Easy Accordion

An accordion and associated navigation.

Coming soon!

### JSX support

There is now support for JSX in the form of [Juxtapose](https://github.com/djalbat/Juxtapose). What this means is that Easy *will* now help you with the architecture of your large application. So although Easy elements will continue to work standalone, their use with Juxtapose is recommended.
